# Next Game

A group collaboration during the UNCC Programming Boot Camp. This application is the group's best attempt during the allotted time the assignment was tasked to create their own website. We wanted to create an application that would help people who play video games find a new game to play. Based on user input we access either the IGDB API or Rawg.io's API to find games that are similar to the titles that the user inputs or for the specific game they input. The site uses local storage and a firebase user authentication system for enhanced user experience. Users can keep track of their search history, games they're interested in and different stats that are kept track of and updated throughout their use of the site. 

## Prerequisites

In order to use the site users must sign up using one of the buttons in the site's nav bar. A basic form will ask for their email and password.
